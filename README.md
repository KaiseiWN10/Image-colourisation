This project uses a U-Net convolutional neural network to colourise black-and-white images using TensorFlow and Keras. It was created as part of a cultural heritage artefact to explore how AI can enhance engagement with historical media.

## Features
- Colourises black-and-white images with high visual accuracy.
- U-Net architecture preserves spatial detail using skip connections.
- Easily extendable to other datasets or image-to-image translation tasks.
